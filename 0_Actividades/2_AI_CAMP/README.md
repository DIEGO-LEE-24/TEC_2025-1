ðŸŽ¯ AI-Based Automatic Targeting Balloon Launcher  

ðŸ”¥ Project Overview  
This project is an AI-based automatic targeting balloon launcher using Python and Raspberry Pi.  

- Uses Raspberry Pi and three motors to automatically aim at targets  
- Employs OpenCV to detect balloon colors  
- Fires automatically after the user gives the launch command  

ðŸ›  Technologies & Equipment  
- Hardware: Raspberry Pi, three motors, spring-based launcher  
- Software: OpenCV, NumPy, GPIO library  

ðŸŽ¯ How It Works  
1. Color Detection: The camera detects the color of the balloon.  
2. Motor Adjustment: The system automatically moves the motors based on the detected color.  
3. User Command: When the user gives the launch signal, the system automatically loads and fires.
